# 🎧 YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis (with DeBERTa)

Ever wondered what people *really* feel in the YouTube comment section?  
This project dives into that chaotic world and extracts **emotion** — one comment at a time.

Using **Microsoft’s DeBERTa model**, this notebook classifies YouTube comments into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. Built with 🤗 Transformers and some late-night coding hustle.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `Sentiment-YT-DeBERTa.ipynb` — Main notebook for training/testing the model  
- `cleaned_youtube_reviews.csv` — Preprocessed comment data with sentiment labels  
- `README.md` — You’re looking at it

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- HuggingFace Transformers  
- PyTorch  
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adiprabhu04/sentiment-youtube-bert.git
   cd sentiment-youtube-bert
````

2. **Install the dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Launch the notebook**

   * Open `Sentiment-YT-DeBERTa.ipynb` using Jupyter, VS Code, or [Google Colab](#)
   * Run all cells

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

* Cleans and tokenizes YouTube comments
* Uses DeBERTa (a transformer model from Microsoft) to understand text
* Trains a sentiment classifier
* Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## 🤖 Why DeBERTa?

Because it’s like BERT but smarter —
Disentangled attention + better context understanding = 🔥 performance
And let’s be real... the name just sounds cooler.

## 📊 Example Results (WIP)

You can fill this once training is done:

* Accuracy: \~86.4%
* F1 Score: \~0.88
* Epochs: 4
* Class balance: Handled via label distribution

---

## 🌱 Future Plans

* Add a web demo with Streamlit or Gradio
* Upload model to Hugging Face Hub
* Expand to multilingual comment support (Hindi, Hinglish, etc.)
* Scrape real-time comments using YouTube API
